This folder is the entry point to other versions of salome_meca
(than v2022 which is included in this WSL distribution).

For example, if you would like to execute the 2020 version of
salome_meca (knowing that this WSL comes with v2022), this is
possible by copying the salome-meca-2020 sif file into this 
folder (/containers).

cp /path/to/salome-meca-xxx.sif /containers

Alternatively, it is possible to just create a symbolic link
here to the SIF file.

cd /containers && ln -s /path/to/salome-meca-xxx.sif

Once the SIF file is available in this folder, you can use
the following shortcuts within the container :

cont_salome_meca
cont_astk
cont_as_run
cont_run_aster

Note that a little overhead in terms of performance can be
encountered when using this method, compared to the use of the
version that is pre-installed natively in this WSL distribution.

This overhead is due to the performance of singularity containers
(and containers in general) in WSL.
